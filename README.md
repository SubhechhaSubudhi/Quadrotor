# Quadrotor
System Modeling and Control
Executing the calc.m code gives you the quiver plot of the coordinates of the quadrotor after time 5 X tspan whose angular speed of rotors are given by "omega".
Initial coordinates are given by tauE.
Initial roll, pitch and yaw angles are given by thetaE.
'E' denotes earth frame parameters and 'B' denotes body frame parameters.
